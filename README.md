# Mobility Control Tower

## Overview

Apache Airflow orchestrates the command-line workflows for daily static processing, bounded realtime collection, and incremental historical refresh. DAGs preserve the established ownership boundaries instead of embedding alternative transformation logic in the scheduler.

## Orchestration

```text
Airflow DAG -> CLI tasks -> Python ingestion/layers -> dbt Gold -> quality -> DuckDB publication
                    \-> realtime history -> watermark advanced last
```

The incremental DAG orders collection, analytical refresh, validation, publication, and watermark commitment so failure leaves the previous accepted state recoverable. See [`airflow/README.md`](airflow/README.md), [`docs/architecture/airflow_dag_overview.md`](docs/architecture/airflow_dag_overview.md), and [`docs/historical_collection.md`](docs/historical_collection.md).

## Verification and Limitations

Tests validate DAG structure without presenting scheduler import success as runtime proof. CI now treats quality, dbt parsing, container configuration, production overlay validation, alert rules, and recovery checks as release gates.

## Release-proof verification

The CI workflow and recovery tests fail closed when a required validation tool or recovery proof is unavailable. See [`docs/backup_recovery.md`](docs/backup_recovery.md).
